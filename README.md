# peak-classifier

## Description

peak-classifier classify ChIP/ATAC-Seq peaks based on features provided in
a GFF file.

Peaks are provided in a BED file sorted by chromosome and position.  Typically
these are output from a peak caller such as MACS2, or the differential
analysis that follows.  The GFF must also be sorted by chromosome, position,
and subfeature, which is the default for common data sources.

Peak-classifier generates features that are not explicitly identified in the
GFF, such as introns and potential promoter regions, and outputs the augmented
feature list to a BED file.  It then identifies overlapping features by
running bedtools intersect on the augmented feature list and peak list,
outputting an annotated BED-like TSV file with additional columns to describe
the feature.  If a peak overlaps multiple features, a separate line is output
for each.

Alternative approaches to this problem include R scripting with a tool such
as ChIPpeakAnno or multistage processing of the GFF using awk and bedtools.

In contrast, peak-classifier is a simple Unix command that takes a BED file
and a GFF file as inputs and reports all peak classifications in a matter of
seconds.

Admittedly, an optimal C program isn't really necessary to solve this problem,
since the crappiest implementation I can imagine would not take more than
hours to run for a typical ATAC-Seq peak set.  However:

    * It's an opportunity to develop and test biolibc code that will be
      useful for other problems and bigger data
    * It's more about making peak classification convenient than fast
    * It never hurts to hone your C skills
    * There's no such thing as a program that's too fast

## Design and Implementation

The code is organized following basic object-oriented design principals, but
implemented in C to minimize overhead and keep the source code accessible to
scientists who don't have time to master the complexities of C++.

Structures are treated as classes, with accessor macros and mutator functions
provided, so dependent applications and libraries need not access
structure members directly.  Since the C language cannot enforce this, it's
up to application programmers to exercise self-discipline.

## Building and installing

peak-classifier is intended to build cleanly in any POSIX environment on
any CPU architecture.  Please
don't hesitate to open an issue if you encounter problems on any
Unix-like system.

Primary development is done on FreeBSD with clang, but the code is frequently
tested on Linux, MacOS, NetBSD, and OpenIndiana as well.  MS Windows is not supported,
unless using a POSIX environment such as Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The Makefile is designed to be friendly to package managers, such as
[Debian packages](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages),
[FreeBSD ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/),
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org/), etc.

End users should install using a package manager, to ensure that
dependencies are properly managed.

I maintain a FreeBSD port and a pkgsrc package, which is sufficient to install
cleanly on virtually any POSIX platform.  If you would like to see a
package in another package manager, please consider creating a package
yourself.  This will be one of the easiest packages in the collection and
hence a good vehicle to learn how to create packages.

Note that pkgsrc can be used by anyone, on virtually any POSIX operating
system, with or without administrator privileges.

For an overview of available package managers, see the
[Repology website](https://repology.org/).

### Installing peak-classifier on FreeBSD:

FreeBSD is a highly underrated platform for scientific computing, with over
2,000 scientific libraries and applications in the FreeBSD ports collection
(of more than 30,000 total), modern clang compiler, fully-integrated ZFS
filesystem, and renowned security, performance, and reliability.
FreeBSD has a somewhat well-earned reputation for being difficult to set up
and manage compared to user-friendly systems like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
However, if you're a little bit Unix-savvy, you can very quickly set up a
workstation, laptop, or VM using
[desktop-installer](http://www.acadix.biz/desktop-installer.php).
[GhostBSD](https://ghostbsd.org/) offers an experience very similar
to Ubuntu, but is built on FreeBSD rather than Debian Linux.  GhostBSD
packages lag behind FreeBSD ports slightly, but this is not generally
an issue and there are workarounds.

To install the binary package on FreeBSD:

```
pkg install peak-classifier
```

You can just as easily build and install from source.  This is useful for
FreeBSD ports with special build options, for building with non-portable
optimizations such as -march=native, and for 
[work-in-progress ports](https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip),
for which binary packages are not yet maintained.

```
cd /usr/ports/biology/peak-classifier && env CFLAGS='-march=native -O2' make install
cd /usr/ports/wip/peak-classifier && make install
```

### Installing via pkgsrc

pkgsrc is a cross-platform package manager that works on any Unix-like
platform. It is native to [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) and well-supported
on [Illumos](https://illumos.org/), [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/),
[RHEL](https://www.redhat.com)/[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and
many other Linux distributions.
Using pkgsrc does not require admin privileges.  You can install a pkgsrc
tree in any directory to which you have write access and easily install any
of the nearly 20,000 packages in the collection.

The
[auto-pkgsrc-setup](https://github.com/outpaddling/auto-admin/blob/master/User-scripts/auto-pkgsrc-setup)
script will help you install pkgsrc in about 10 minutes.  Just download it
and run

```
sh auto-pkgsrc-setup
```

Then, assuming you selected current packages and the default prefix

```
source ~/Pkgsrc/pkg/etc/pkgsrc.sh   # Or pkgsrc.csh for csh or tcsh
cd ~/Pkgsrc/pkgsrc/biology/peak-classifier
sbmake install clean clean-depends
```

See the [pkgsrc documentation](https://pkgsrc.org/) for more information.

Community support for pkgsrc is available through the
[pkgsrc-users](http://netbsd.org/mailinglists) mailing list.

## Instructions for packagers

If you would like to add this project to another package manager
rather than use FreeBSD ports or pkgsrc, basic manual build instructions
for package can be found
[here](https://github.com/outpaddling/Coding-Standards/blob/main/package.md).
Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
